**Traffic Control Test Bed** is a platform on which traffic control systems can be evaluated and benchmarked against each other on an open and level playing field. The platform includes a library of microsimulation network models and test configurations for the evaluation of traffic control systems.

The platform is based on the popular open source microsimulation software package [SUMO(Simulation of Urban MObility)](http://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/Simulation_of_Urban_MObility_-_Wiki).
