**Traffic Control Test Bed** is a platform on which traffic control systems can be evaluated and benchmarked against each other on an open and level playing field. The platform includes a library of microsimulation network models and test configurations for the evaluation of traffic control systems.

The platform is based on the popular open source microsimulation software package [SUMO(Simulation of Urban MObility)](http://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/Simulation_of_Urban_MObility_-_Wiki).

## Demo

A case study using the Traffic Control Test Bed platform comparing different traffic control systems at the Northfield roundabout off Junction 14 of the M1 motorway, a strategic location connecting the city of Milton Keynes to the motorway network.
