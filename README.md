The Traffic Control Test Bed project aims to develop a platform on which traffic control systems can be evaluated and benchmarked against each other on an open and level playing field. The platform includes a library of microsimulation network models and test configurations for the evaluation of traffic control systems. We are also developing software APIs to enable the straightforward connection of traffic control systems to the test bed platform.
