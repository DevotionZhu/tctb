summary: Developing a standard test set for evaluating traffic control technologies.
---

## Objective

This project aims to develop a standard set of microsimulation models and test configurations for the evaluation of traffic control systems. We are also developing an API to enable the straightforward connection of your traffic control system. You should consider using this standard test set to evaluate your traffic control system because it will enable you to benchmark the performance of your system against many others on a level playing field.

## Collaboration

The project is being developed jointly by the [Transportation Research Group at the University of Southampton](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/engineering/research/groups/transportation_group.page?) and the [Transport and Planning Department at TU Delft](http://www.citg.tudelft.nl/no_cache/en/about-faculty/departments/transport-and-planning/).

The project was originally hosted at [http://tctester.sourceforge.net/](http://tctester.sourceforge.net/).
