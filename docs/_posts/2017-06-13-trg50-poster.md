The [Transportation Research Group](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/engineering/research/groups/transportation_group.page) is celebrating its 50th Anniversary. We will be presenting our work during the celebration event on 10 July 2017. Come and join us to find out more about the project and other research within TRG.

We are going to the [TSC IMAGINE festival](http://imaginefestival.co.uk/) next week! We will be demonstrating the current state of the platform.

For a given combination of junction layout and traffic demand, a selection of control systems are initialised to take over the traffic control duties before simulations begin. During runtime, each control system is contained within its own simulator to avoid interference. All simulations are synchronised, and have the same junction layout (cross junction) and traffic demand (generated in runtime). An example of the benchmarking process is shown in this video:
