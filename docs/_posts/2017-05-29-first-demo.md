Take a first look at the benchmarking process. In the example shown in this video, four intersection control systems: Priority, Roundabout, Generic Traffic Light, and Loop-Assisted Traffic Light are being benchmarked simultaneously on a cross junction layout. Key performance indicators such as Traffic Throughput, CO2 Emission, and Waiting Time are recorded and plotted at runtime.
