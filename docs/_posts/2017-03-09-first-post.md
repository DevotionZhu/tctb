This project aims to develop a standard set of microsimulation models and test configurations for the evaluation of traffic control systems. We are also developing an API to enable the straightforward connection of your traffic control system. You should consider using this standard test set to evaluate your traffic control system because it will enable you to benchmark the performance of your system against many others on a level playing field.

Stay tuned.
